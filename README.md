# Webpack Config for WordPress

A shared Webpack config for WordPress projects.

## Usage

This config will assume the entry point of your project is `src/index.js` and will output the result in `dist/`.

However, you can use [webpack-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge) to customise these paths.
